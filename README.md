- Revert commit with message `commit to be reverted`

#### 2. Prettier
- Add the package
- Configure the prettier to use single quote everywhere
- Make sure the prettier prettifies the source files before start (hint: use package.json file for it and google for npm CLI scripts)

#### 3. Next
- Edit `QrBox.js` so that it renders Qr code with correct data (use some package from npm)
- Create context with selected tab state
- Connect `Tabs` to the context
- Connect `Alert` to the context and display selected tab index (something like: `Current selected tab: 0`)
- Add new color `primary-yellow` to the Tailwind theme with value `#FABB00`
- Optimize the code however You like :)
